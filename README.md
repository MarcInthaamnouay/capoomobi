# CapooMobi

Capoomobi is a project where I'm learning rust ! Capoomobi is a helper tool allowing you to generate a Kubernetes boilerplate files from your docker-compose file

## Idea

Ever wondering how hard is to translate a simple to a set of complex docker-compose to a set of Kubernetes objects ? Well this project aim to render this process automatic.

Deploying your docker-compose to Kubernetes with ease

## Examples

capoomobi init rabbit ../rabbit
```
